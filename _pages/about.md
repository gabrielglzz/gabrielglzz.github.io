I am a Computer Engineer and Researcher at the **Albacete Research Institute of Informatics (I3A)**, belonging to the **Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM)**. I hold a **PhD in Advanced Information Technologies** (Cum Laude, December 2025), as well as a Master’s Degree (2021) and a Bachelor’s Degree (2020) in Computer Engineering from the same university.

My research interests focus on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** interconnection networks and Data Centers. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical design and real-world deployment, addressing critical challenges such as topology implementation, congestion control, and exascale architecture simulation.

My main scientific contributions include:
*   **Topology Implementation:** I successfully deployed and evaluated the first known implementation of a **KNS (k-ary n-tree s-indirect) topology** in a real InfiniBand cluster (CELLIA), demonstrating its feasibility and cost-efficiency.
*   **Congestion Control (CC):** I developed dynamic CC mechanisms based on **fine-grain monitoring** (using tools like LIMITLESS) to reduce network overreaction and Head-of-Line blocking.
*   **Simulation Frameworks:** I have extended the **SAURON** simulator to model next-generation architectures (such as **BXIv3**) and integrated it with **COSSIM** to simulate heterogeneous systems (RISC-V/ARM), contributing to the European **RED-SEA project**.

During my PhD, I completed international research stays at **CERN** (Geneva, Switzerland), modeling the Data Acquisition System (DAQ) for the ATLAS experiment, and at **FORTH** (Heraklion, Greece), working on advanced congestion control mechanisms.

Currently, I am substitute professor for the subject Computer Networks in the Computer Engineering degree program in Albacete.
