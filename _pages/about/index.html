I hold a <strong>PhD in Advanced Information Technologies</strong> (Cum Laude, December 2025), as well as a Master’s Degree (2021) and a Bachelor’s Degree (2020) in Computer Engineering from the same university.</p> <p>My research interests focus on <strong>High-Performance Computing (HPC)</strong> interconnection networks and Data Centers. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical design and real-world deployment, addressing critical challenges such as topology implementation, congestion control, and exascale architecture simulation.</p> <p>My main scientific contributions include:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Topology Implementation:</strong> I successfully deployed and evaluated the first known implementation of a <strong>KNS (k-ary n-tree s-indirect) topology</strong> in a real InfiniBand cluster (CELLIA), demonstrating its feasibility and cost-efficiency.</li> <li> <strong>Congestion Control (CC):</strong> I developed dynamic CC mechanisms based on <strong>fine-grain monitoring</strong> (using tools like LIMITLESS) to reduce network overreaction and Head-of-Line blocking.</li> <li> <strong>Simulation Frameworks:</strong> I have extended the <strong>SAURON</strong> simulator to model next-generation architectures (such as <strong>BXIv3</strong>) and integrated it with <strong>COSSIM</strong> to simulate heterogeneous systems (RISC-V/ARM), contributing to the European <strong>RED-SEA project</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>During my PhD, I completed international research stays at <strong>CERN</strong> (Geneva, Switzerland), modeling the Data Acquisition System (DAQ) for the ATLAS experiment, and at <strong>FORTH</strong> (Heraklion, Greece), working on advanced congestion control mechanisms.</p> <p>Currently, I am substitute professor for the subject Computer Networks in the Computer Engineering degree program in Albacete.</p> </body></html>
